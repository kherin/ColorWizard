ColorWizard is a Python-based project that aims to automate the coloring process of physical coloring books. It uses computer vision techniques to scan and detect the regions in a coloring book page, and then automatically applies colors to those regions, creating a digitally colored version of the page.

## Features

-   **Region Segmentation**: The project employs image processing algorithms to segment the coloring book page into distinct regions, each representing a separate area to be colored.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kherin/ColorWizard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd ColorWizard`

3. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run the ColorWizard server:

`python server.py`

Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

_Process_video.py_ üìÑ

The process_video.py file contains the core functionality for processing the coloring book pages. It imports the necessary libraries and defines functions to perform the following tasks:

Image Preprocessing: This function prepares the uploaded image for further processing by resizing, converting to grayscale, and applying various filters and transformations.
Region Segmentation: This function uses computer vision algorithms to segment the coloring book page into distinct regions, each representing a separate area to be colored.

The process_video.py file is imported and utilized by the server application (server.py) to handle the image processing and coloring tasks.

_video_capture.html_ üìÑ

The video_capture.html file is an HTML template that provides the user interface for the ColorWizard web application.
